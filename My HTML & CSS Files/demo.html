            Commenting is one such
            practice that is often
            ignored by programmers,
            especially for codes that 
            are written by multiple
            programmers.But remember,
            commenting is an important
            part of project you create.
            With proper comments and
            organised files its always 
            easier for you or others to 
            jump in and understand 
            where things are at and how 
            they work.

            By "refactoring" your code, you're only enhancing
            the code without tampering with its functionality.
